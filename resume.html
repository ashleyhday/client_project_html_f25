        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>How long should my resume be?</strong><br>
            For most UMSI students and new grads, one page is best. More experienced professionals may require two

          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Do I need a different resume for each application?</strong><br>
            It’s wise to tailor your resume to the requirements and keywords of each opportunity.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Is it okay to include coursework or student projects?</strong><br>
            Absolutely! UMSI coursework and projects are valued by employers, especially if they show relevant skills
            and
            impact.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>How often should I update my resume?</strong><br>
            Update your resume every semester, after major projects, or whenever you gain a new role or responsibility.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>What if I have gaps in my experience?</strong><br>
            Focus on skills and experiences you do have. Consider including relevant coursework, volunteer work, or
            freelance projects.
